= iThemes Security (formerly Better WP Security), #1 WordPress Security Plugin =

iThemes Security (formerly Better WP Security) gives you over 30+ ways to secure and protect your WordPress site. On average, 30,000 new websites are hacked each day. WordPress sites can be an easy target for attacks because of plugin vulnerabilities, weak passwords and obsolete software.

Most WordPress admins don't even know they’re vulnerable, but iThemes Security works to fix common holes, stop automated attacks and strengthen user credentials. With one-click activation for most features, as well as advanced features for experienced users, iThemes Security can help protect any WordPress site.

= Maintained and Supported by iThemes =

iThemes has been building and supporting WordPress tools since 2008. With our full range of WordPress <a href="http://ithemes.com/find/plugins/">plugins</a>, <a href="http://ithemes.com/find/themes/">themes</a> and <a href="http://webdesign.com">training</a>, WordPress security is the next step in providing you with everything you need to build the WordPress web.

= Get Support and Pro Features =

Get added peace of mind with professional support from our expert team and pro features to take your site's security to the next level with <a href="http://ithemes.com/security">iThemes Security Pro</a>.

Pro Features:

= iThemes Sync Integration =

Manage more than one site? Manage away mode, release lockouts and make sure your WordPress site is up to date with <a href="http://ithemes.com/sync/">iThemes Sync</a>.

= New! iThemes Brute Force Protection Network =

Network Brute Force Protection takes brute force protection to the next level by further banning users who have tried to break into other sites from breaking into yours. The iThemes Brute Force Protection Network will automatically report IP addresses of failed login attempts to iThemes and will block them for a length of time necessary to protect your site based on the number of sites that have seen a similar attack.

= Obscure =

iThemes Security hides common WordPress security vulnerabilities, preventing attackers from learning too much about your site and away from sensitive areas like your site's login, admin, etc.

* Changes the URLs for WordPress dashboard areas including login, admin and more
* Completely turns off the ability to login for a given time period (away mode)
* Removes the meta "Generator" tag
* Removes theme, plugin, and core update notifications from users who do not have permission to update them
* Removes Windows Live Write header information
* Removes RSD header information
* Renames "admin" account
* Changes the ID on the user with ID 1
* Changes the Wordpress database table prefix
* Changes wp-content path
* Removes login error messages
* Displays a random version number to non administrative users

= Protect =

Hiding parts of your site is helpful, but won't prevent all attacks. In addition to obscuring sensitive areas of your WordPress site, iThemes Security works to protect it by blocking bad users and increasing the security of passwords and other vital information.

* Scans your site to instantly report where vulnerabilities exist and fixes them in seconds
* Bans troublesome user agents, bots and other hosts
* Prevents brute force attacks by banning hosts and users with too many invalid login attempts
* Strengthens server security
* Enforces strong passwords for all accounts of a configurable minimum role
* Forces SSL for admin pages (on supporting servers)
* Forces SSL for any page or post (on supporting servers)
* Turns off file editing from within Wordpress admin area
* Detects and blocks numerous attacks to your filesystem and database

= Detect =

iThemes Security monitors your site and reports changes to the filesystem and database that might indicate a compromise. iThemes Security also works to detect bots and other attempts to search vulnerabilities.

* Detects bots and other attempts to search for vulnerabilities
* Monitors filesystem for unauthorized changes
* Run a scan for blacklists on the homepage of your site
* Receive email notifications when someone gets locked out after too many failed login attempts or when a file on your site has been changed.

= Recover =

iThemes Security makes regular backups of your WordPress database, allowing you to get back online quickly in the event of an attack. Use iThemes Security to create and email database backups on a customizable schedule.

For complete site backups and the ability to restore or move WordPress easily, check out <a href="http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy">BackupBuddy</a> by iThemes.

= Other Benefits =

* Makes it easier for users not accustomed to WordPress to remember login and admin URLs by customizing default admin URLs
* Detects hidden 404 errors on your site that can affect your SEO such as bad links and missing images
* Removes the existing jQuery version used and replaces it with a safe version (the version that comes default with WordPress).

= Warning =

Please read the installation instructions and FAQ before installing this plugin. iThemes Security makes significant changes to your database and other site files which can be problematic, so a backup is strongly recommended before making any changes to your site with this plugin. While problems are rare, most support requests involve the failure to make a proper backup before installation.

== Installation ==

NOTE: iThemes Security makes significant changers to your database and other site files which can be problematic, so a backup is strongly recommended before making any changes to your site with this plugin. While problems are rare, most support requests involve the failure to make a proper backup before installation.

1. BEFORE YOU BEGIN: Back up your Wordpress database, config file, and .htaccess file. We recommend using <a href="http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy">BackupBuddy</a>, our WordPress backup plugin for a complete site backup.
2. Upload the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Unzip
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
5. Visit the Security menu for checklist and options

DISCLAIMER: Under no circumstances do we release this plugin with any warranty, implied or otherwise. We cannot be held responsible for any damage that might arise from the use of this plugin.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does iThemes Security require the latest WordPress version? Can't I use a slightly older version? =
* One of the best security practices for a WordPress site owner is keeping software up to date. Because of this, we only test this plugin on the latest stable version of WordPress and will only guarantee it works in the latest version.

= Will this plugin completely stop all attacks on my site? =
* No. iThemes Security is designed to help improve the security of your WordPress installation from many common attack methods, but it cannot prevent every possible attack. Nothing replaces diligence and good practice. This plugin makes it a little easier for you to apply both.

= Is "one-click" protection good enough? =
* One-click protection will help reduce the risk of attack on your site, but we recommend fixing as many high, medium and low priority items in the Security Status section as possible. If you have a plugin or theme that conflicts with an iThemes Security feature, we recommend deactivating the offending feature.

= Is this plugin only for new WordPress installs or can I use it on existing sites, too? =
* Many of the changes made by this plugin are complex and can break existing sites. While iThemes Security can be installed on either a new or existing site, we strongly recommend making a <a href="http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy" target="_blank">complete backup</a> of your existing site before applying any features included in this plugin.

= Will this plugin work on all servers and hosts? =
* iThemes Security requires Apache or LiteSpeed and mod_rewrite or NGINX to work.
* While this plugin should work on all hosts with Apache or LiteSpeed and mod_rewrite or NGINX, it has been known to experience problems in shared hosting environments where it runs out of resources such as available CPU or RAM. For this reason, it is extremely important that you make a backup of your site before installing on any existing site. If you run out of resources during an operation such as renaming your database table, you may need your backup to be able to restore access to your site.
* Finally, please make sure you have adequate RAM if you plan to use the file change detector or make large backups.

= Does this work with network or multisite installations? =
* Yes. We're in the process of developing more documentation, so we'll update this as soon as it's ready.

= Can I help? =
* Of course! We are in constant need of testers. In addition, we can always use help with translations for internationalization. <a href="http://ithemes.com/contributing-to-ithemes-security/">For more information on contributing to iThemes Security, visit this page</a>.

= What changes does this plugin make that can break my site? =
* iThemes Security makes significant changes to your database and other site files which can be problematic for existing WordPress sites. Again, we strongly recommended making a complete backup of your site before using this plugin. While problems are rare, most support requests involve the failure to make a proper backup before installation. DISCLAIMER: Under no circumstances do we release this plugin with any warranty, implied or otherwise. We cannot be held responsible for any damage that might arise from the use of this plugin.
* Note that renaming the wp-content directory will not update the path in existing content. Use this feature only on new sites or in a situation where you can easily update all existing links.

* <a href="http://ithemes.com/what-is-changed-by-ithemes-security/">What is Changed By iThemes Security</a>

= I've enabled the Enforce SSL option and it broke my site. How do I get back in? =
* Open your wp-config.php file in a text editor and remove the following 2 lines:
* define('FORCE_SSL_LOGIN', true);
* define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);

= Where can I get help if something goes wrong? =
* Official support for this plugin is available for <a href="http://ithemes.com/security/" target="_blank">iThemes Security Pro</a> customers. Our team of experts is ready to help.

Free support may be available with the help of the community in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ithemes-security" target="_blank">WordPress.org support forums</a> (Note: this is community-provided support. iThemes does not monitor the WordPress.org support forums).
